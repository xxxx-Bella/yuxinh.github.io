- :pencil: I am a first-year PhD student in Data Science at Lingnan University, supervised by [Prof. Sam KWONG](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=_PVI6EAAAAAJ&hl=en). I received my M.Eng. degree in Computer Science and Technology from South-Central Minzu University in 2025, supervised by [Prof. Xiao ZHANG](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yGg0OisAAAAJ&hl=en). Prior to that, I obtained my B.Eng. degree in Data Science and Big Data Technology from Huazhong Agriculture University in 2022. I have also worked as a research intern at the Centre for Frontier AI Research (CFAR), A*STAR, Singapore, under the supervision of [Prof. Joey Tianyi ZHOU](https://joeyzhouty.github.io/index.html) and [Dr. Jiawei DU](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WrJKEzEAAAAJ&hl=en). My current research interests focus on computer vision and data-centric efficiency.

- :mortar_board: I am always interested in collaborating on research projects and publications. Please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out.
