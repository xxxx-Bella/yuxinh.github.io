- :pencil: I am a final-year master student in Computer Science & Technology at South-Central Minzu University, supervised by [Prof. Zhang Xiao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yGg0OisAAAAJ&hl=en). I was an intern at A*STAR's Centre for Frontier AI Research (CFAR), Singapore, supervised by [Prof. Joey Tianyi Zhou](https://joeyzhouty.github.io/index.html) and [Dr. Jiawei Du](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WrJKEzEAAAAJ&hl=en). My current research interests focus on computer vision and data-centric efficiency.

- :mortar_board: I'm actively pursuing a PhD position in Computer Science & Engineering for Fall 2025. If you're interested, please feel free to contact me!
