- I am a final-year Master student of South-Central Minzu University supervised by [Prof. Zhang Xiao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yGg0OisAAAAJ&hl=en). I was a visiting student in A*STAR Centre for Frontier AI Research (CFAR), Singapore, supervised by [Prof. Joey Tianyi Zhou](https://joeyzhouty.github.io/index.html) and [Dr. Jiawei Du](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WrJKEzEAAAAJ&hl=en). My current research interests focus on data-centric efficiency and video anomaly detection.

- I'm actively looking for a PhD position for Fall 2025. If you're interested, please feel free to contact me!
